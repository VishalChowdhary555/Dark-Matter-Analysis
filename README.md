Project Title: Dark Matter Analysis using WIMP, Axion Physics, Hidden Dark Sector in QCD and Sterile Neutrinos


Overview

This project explores the theoretical frameworks and mathematical formulations related to dark matter, specifically focusing on Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), axion physics, and the hidden dark sector in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and sterile neutrinos. The analysis is performed using symbolic mathematics and numerical simulations to understand the interactions and properties of these particles.


Contents

Dark Matter Analysis Notebook: The main Jupyter Notebook (Dark_Matter_Analysis_using_WIMP,_Axion_Physics,_Hidden_Dark_Sector_in_QCD_and_Sterile_Neutrinos.ipynb) contains the following key components:

Introduction to Dark Matter: A brief overview of dark matter and its significance in cosmology and particle physics.

Symbolic Mathematics: Implementation of symbolic calculations using the SymPy library to derive equations related to QCD and dark matter interactions.

Running Coupling Constant: Calculation and visualization of the running coupling constant in QCD.

WIMP Model Analysis: A model for dark matter analysis using WIMPs, including the calculation of cross-sections for particle interactions.
